# Assets

This folder contains all static content from outside sources which is
neither code nor generated by code.

This includes, but is not limited to, schematics generated from biorender, other images taken from outside sources,
`csl` files, `bib` files, pdf files of references, etc.



The `csl` files are referenced in our Quarto docs and will influence the style of the references both in the text and at the reference listing at the end.


While writing, we will use the more explicit (Author, year) format (as e.g. implemented in `vancouver-author-date`) . 


You can check the `.bib` file to see the reference list.
