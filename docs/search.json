Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in.

Those should look as nice, polished and easy to understand as possible."

The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the results folder.\nIt’s the same code done 3 times:\n\nFirst, there is an R script that you can run which does all the computations.\nSecond, there is a Quarto file which contains exactly the same code as the R script.\nThird, my current favorite, is a Quarto file with an approach where the code is pulled in from the R script and run.\n\nThe last version has the advantage of having code in one place for easy writing/debugging, and then being able to pull the code into the Quarto file for a nice combination of text/commentary and code.\nEach way of doing this is a reasonable approach, pick whichever one you prefer or makes the most sense for your setup. Whichever approach you choose, add ample documentation/commentary so you and others can easily understand what’s going on and what is done."

The near-zero R-squared suggests that the synthetic revenue values do not follow a clear increasing or decreasing trend over time. This likely results from the random assignment of Data_Value, which does not capture the expected real-world growth or decline. ## Summary Statistics of Revenue for Selected States\n\n# Summarizing Data Value for five selected states\nsummary_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(LocationDesc) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    count = n(), \n    mean = mean(Data_Value, na.rm = TRUE), \n    median = median(Data_Value, na.rm = TRUE), \n    min = min(Data_Value, na.rm = TRUE), \n    max = max(Data_Value, na.rm = TRUE), \n    sd = sd(Data_Value, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n# Viewing the summary result\nprint(summary_data)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 7\n  LocationDesc count        mean     median       min        max         sd\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;int&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Alabama         31  897512416.  960156234  48443527 1592272124 459682451.\n2 Georgia         31 1041163227.  931027872 119283033 1795190468 483486517.\n3 Idaho           31  962935962.  953346293  37056961 1801657976 502962014.\n4 Kansas          31  940194286.  927004867 133488936 1853330662 507391652.\n5 Nebraska        31 1045789591. 1068338750  14826708 1851782104 515086985.\n\n\nThe summary statistics for the five selected states indicate that each state has 31 observations, maintaining a balanced dataset. However, the mean and median values show high variability, suggesting inconsistencies in how Data_Value was generated. The wide range between min and max values and high standard deviation indicate that the synthetic data may still be too random rather than following a structured trend. ## Final Summary of the Dataset\n\nsummary(data)\n\n LocationDesc       LocationAbbr            Year        Data_Value       \n Length:155         Length:155         Min.   :1970   Min.   :1.483e+07  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:1977   1st Qu.:5.343e+08  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :1985   Median :9.591e+08  \n                                       Mean   :1985   Mean   :9.775e+08  \n                                       3rd Qu.:1993   3rd Qu.:1.388e+09  \n                                       Max.   :2000   Max.   :1.853e+09  \n GeoLocation       \n Length:155        \n Class :character  \n Mode  :character  \n                   \n                   \n                   \n\n\nFrom the outputs, my synthetic dataset maintains the correct structure with selected variables such as LocationDesc, Year, and Data_Value, ensuring consistency. However, the regression analysis for Georgia and Alabama shows very low R-squared values (0.0016 and 0.0078, respectively) and high p-values (0.7798 and 0.5419), indicating no significant relationship between Year and Data_Value. Additionally, while the mean and median values for each state appear reasonable, the wide range and high standard deviation suggest excessive randomness in Data_Value generation."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/LibraryUser/Documents/GitHub/prasangapaudel-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"
